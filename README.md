# Robotic-Hand

# Robotic Hand Project 🤖✋

A robotic hand controlled using an **Arduino**, **4 servos**, and a **28BYJ-48 stepper motor**. The system mimics human hand and wrist movement using real-time input processed through **Python**.

## Features
- Thumb controlled independently with its own servo  
- Index and middle fingers controlled individually  
- Ring and pinky fingers mapped together to one servo  
- Wrist rotation controlled by a stepper motor (28BYJ-48 + ULN2003)  
- Servo smoothing for stable, natural motion  

## Hardware
- Arduino (Uno or equivalent)  
- 4× Servo motors  
- 28BYJ-48 stepper motor + ULN2003 driver  

## Software
- Arduino IDE  
- Python (gesture detection & serial communication)  

## Status
Functional prototype with gesture-based control. Ongoing improvements focus on motion accuracy and mechanical refinement.
